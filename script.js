/*Create a menu app as seen in this weekâ€™s video. What you create is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements:

    Use at least one array.
    Use at least two classes.
    Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.
*/

//I decided I wanted to create a menu that allowed users to create characters as well as equipment to add to them.
//To begin with, I defined the character class with a name and role in the constructor, adding an empty array to place items.
class Character {
    constructor(name, role) {
        this.name = name
        this.role = role
        this.inventory = []
    }

    addItem(item) {
        if (item instanceof Item) {
            this.inventory.push(item)
        } else {
            throw new Error(`${item} cannot be added. Please add an Item.`)
        }
    }
//I included a basic describe function in case I needed to refer back to it as well as a more complex function to show the inventory.
/*As most important functionality in the example was in the menu with the functions in the other classes left untouched,
I was unsure about whether I would need these but decided to create them just in case.*/
//Upon altering my code, I needed the describe() function for the characters, and moved the showInventory for loop into it as well.
    describe() {
        let allItems = `Current Inventory:\n`
        for (let i = 0; i < this.inventory.length; i++) {
            allItems += `${this.inventory[i].name} - ${this.inventory[i].type}\n`
        }
        return `${this.name} is a ${this.role} character.\n${allItems}}`
    }
/*After getting frustrated over being required to use a for loop to concatenate a simple array (and for those I still think
join is much better and more efficient), I decided to use a for loop to arrange the objects in this array more neatly.*/
//I commented it out when I edited the describe() function above, but left it in to show what it originally looked like.
    // showInventory() {
    //     let allItems = `Current Inventory:\n`
    //     for (let i = 0; i < this.inventory.length; i++) {
    //         allItems += `${this.inventory[i].name} - ${this.inventory[i].type}\n`
    //     }
    //     return allItems
    // }
}
//The Item class is much more basic, with simply a name and type and basic describe function.
